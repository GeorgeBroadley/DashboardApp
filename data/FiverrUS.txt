My work consisted of only digital artwork and photo editing, so my days working were spent in front of a computer. My clients would message me, describing what they wanted and I would ask them any questions about details that I had. I needed to be very thorough with them in order to get the artwork as close to perfect as I I could. Many of my clients were extremely sweet and friendly, but occasionally, I&#39;d have one or two that were rude and ignorant. The hardest part of the job was the long hours. Some of the work I did was extremely tedious, and since their was a 24 hour time limit I had to use it wisely. I was pretty disciplined about it, with little to no breaks. It was tough, but when a customer was satisfied with my work, it paid off.//Great clients//Long hours, little pay// //2//40//40//40//40//40//It&#39;s ok for meFreelancer SEO Specialist //Current // &ndash;  Online &ndash;//October 28 2017//It&#39;s a platform for skill-based service seller.It&#39;s a good opportunity for most of the service provider.It&#39;s very competitive and it&#39;s cheap and fake service provider are available.// //5//100//100//100//100//100//GreatFreelance //Former // &ndash;  Virginia &ndash;//October 9 2017//Fiverr provides freelancers for the tools necessary for finding and providing specialized products and services for clients.
